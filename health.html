	<h1>Vets!</h1>

	<p>Going to the vets for rabbits can be very stressful so you must make it as calm as you
		can for them you can do this by making the journey as gentle as you can for them talking
		to them in a calm voice and letting them know that there is nothing to be frightened of
		also by lining their crate with hay can make them feel more relaxed like they're at home.
		Also, when you get to the vets covering their crate with a blanket so your rabbit doesn't
		get scared of its surroundings and other pets. Your rabbit will need vaccinating every
		year to prevent diseases and to keep them well and healthy. Rabbit's claws should be
		about ½ cm (1/4 in) long. Rabbits front teeth grow all the time so you should give
		them a wooden block to gnaw on to prevent them growing strange. If their teeth get
		too long you need to ask a vet to shorten them or they'll grow at a strange angle.</p>
